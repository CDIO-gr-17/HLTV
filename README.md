# HLTV 2 Electric boogaloo
This app is developed for the UX and SPP courses at DTU.

# Installation guide

There are several ways to install the app:

**A:  Using an emulator in Android Studio**
1) Make sure to have Android Studio Giraffe installed, and hardware emulation enabled through BIOS
2) Clone the repository and open in Android Studio (In trusting mode)
3) Make sure you are in the Master branch
4) Run the app

**B:  Using an Android phone and an IDE**
1) Make sure to have Android Studio Giraffe installed, or another similar IDE (only tested on AS)
2) Clone the repository and open in your IDE of choice
3) Connect your android phone via USB (Make sure to have USB debugging enabled, and give required permissions)
4) Make sure you are in the Master branch
5a) Run the app (Making sure to select your phone as the target)
6b) If it doesn't happen automatically, run the app on your android phone

If any issues occur during method A or B, we reccomend syncing the project with gradle files as a first response. This is a common cause of issues

**C:  Running the provided APK**
Running the code manually can be bothersome, and following methods A and B can result in poor performance (depending on hardware) because it is not a release build. One of these is provided.
1) Download the APK to a modern Android phone.
2) Install the APK.
3) Run the APK.

**In case of API errors**

The current APP is developed with a very limited API key paid for my group members. The API key allows for 6 requests per second, which *will* be saturated if more than one person uses certain parts of the app at the same time. If this occurs while testing the app, contact any member of the group via email or other contact methods, to ensure that multiple people are not using the app at the same time.
